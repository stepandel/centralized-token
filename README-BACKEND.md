### Challenge Background
Against our better judgement, we have rushed out our own token. We are now left with a slew of customer data and no way of capturing insights and managing accounts! Help us implement an application (requirements below) for the data which is in the following format:
#### Account
* `userEmail` (Account Holder email, unique)
* `status` (Possible values: ['active', 'locked'])
* `createdAt` (Account creation date)
* `updatedAt` (Account update date)
#### Transaction
* `userEmail` (Account Holder Email)
* `amount` (Number of tokens in transaction)
* `type` (Possible values: ['send', 'receive'])
* `createdAt` (Transaction creation date)

A transaction can only be associated with one account. An account can be associated with many transactions.  
Feel free to replace the userEmail field with an ID field generated by your data storage method of choice.  
Sample data files are provided:
  * [`accounts-api.json`](./accounts-api.json).
  * [`accounts-api-large.json`](./accounts-api-large.json).
  * [`transactions-api.json`](./transactions-api.json).
  * [`transactions-api-large.json`](./transactions-api-large.json).

### Requirements
 The API should be able to handle the following requests:
    * Get an account and its current balance.
    * Create `send` and `receive` transactions for an account;
      * No account should have a negative balance
      * No transactions can be made for accounts with status field set to `locked`
    * Update an account status field
